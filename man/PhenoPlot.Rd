\title{
A plotting function for phenological thresholds
}
\description{
This function uses data from a fitted phenological model, the extracted 
metrics and plots them in an annotated graph. 
}
\usage{
PhenoPlot(data, metrics, add = FALSE, show.uncert = TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
Fitted data from a fitting function such as GuFit, SplineFit, KlostermanFit, 
ElmoreFit, BeckFit
}
  \item{metrics}{
  A named vector or a dataframe, depending on the presence or absence of 
  uncertainty estimation 
}
  \item{add}{
  If TRUE the plot is superimposed to an existing one
%%     ~~Describe \code{add} here~~
}
  \item{show.uncert}{
Should uncertainty be shown as error bars around the extracted thresholds? 
It requires that data in imput incorporate the uncertainty estimation.   
%%     ~~Describe \code{show.uncert} here~~
}
  \item{\dots}{
Several argument as in \code{plot} can be specified here, see example.   
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
}
\details{
This function allows to plot fitting and thresholding on a season of gcc 
data. Uncertainty can be also shown
