\title{
A plotting facility to show the combination of uncertainty
}
\description{
The \code{combineUncertainty} uses \code{\link{greenProcess}} to fit all available double logistic equations in the phenopix package and extracts thresholds with all available methods. Then uncertainties can be combined and returned by using \code{\link{summarizePhases}} and plotted with \code{\link{plotSum}}. 
See \code{\link{greenProcess}}. 
}
\usage{
plotSum(ts, sum, which, v=NULL, quantile=TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{ts}{
A ts or zoo object with gcc data. index(ts) must be numeric days of
year (doys) or a POSIXct vector
}
\item{sum}{
An object in output from \code{summarizePhases}
}
\item{which}{
One between trs, derivatives, klosterman, gu
}
\item{v}{
An optional vector of vertical coordinates (in y-axis unit for plot annotation of phase names)
}
\item{quantile}{
If TRUE, the plotted uncertainty envelope is based on the quantiles, and not min-max, otherwise min-max envelope is plotted 
}
  \item{\dots}{
  For the plotting function, a number of parameters from generic \code{plot} 
  can be specified. Note that graphic properties of fitted lines and thresholds
  cannot be modified. See examples.

\details{
This function is the last step of a processing chain. It uses \code{\link{greenProcess}} to fit all available double logistic equations in the phenopix package and extracts thresholds with all available methods. Then uncertainties can be combined and returned by using \code{\link{summarizePhases}} and plotted with \code{\link{plotSum}}. 
See \code{\link{greenProcess}}, \code{\link{summarizePhases}}, \code{\link{plotSum}}. This function uses a model approach to combine all uncertainties from all available phenopix fittings, as to get an ensemble of phases with different methods, without necessarily choosing any of them. 
}

\value{
A named list with dataframes for each phenophase method with all replication for each of the included fitting methods. These data can then be combined with the companion functions \code{\link{summarizePhases}} and \code{\link{plotSum}}. See examples for details.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  require(zoo) 
  data(bartlett2009.filtered)
  combined.fit <- combineUncertainty(na.approx(filtered.tmp$max.filtered), nrep=100)
# 100 replications for each fitting
  names(combined.fit) # a dataframe for each phenoMethod + a list with all fittings
  fit.summary <- summarizePhases(combined.fit, across.methods=TRUE)
## again a list with one element for each fitting method + two additional items 
## if across.methods is TRUE, which combines gu + klosterman phenophase methods 
## in a single method, and the same happens for trs and derivatives
  plotSum(bartlett2009.filtered, fit.summary, which='klosterman')
## a plot with original timeseries + phenophases and their uncertainty
